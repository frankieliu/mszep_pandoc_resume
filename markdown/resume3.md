Education and Career
--------------------

**Staff SW Engineer, Google, CA (2020 - present)**

Led initiatives to optimize delivery and operational efficiency across Google's global data center infrastructure, resulting in multi-million dollar cost savings.

- Designed and deployed a cross-service telemetry platform, enabling real-time anomaly detection and reducing debugging latency by >10x
- Built a system for multi-dimensional data aggregation and ML-assisted root cause analysis, cutting investigation time from weeks to days
- Developed a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LLMs to accelerate support ticket triage, significantly reducing on-call toil

**Member of Technical Staff SW Engineer, Oracle (2010 - 2020)**

Worked on early-stage automation for hardware systems, later transitioning into data-drive design optimization and machine learning applications.

- Automated analog circuit generation at 10nm using ML-inspired design rules, improving performance by >10% and shortening product cycles by ~3.5 weeks
- Initiated internal tools integrating simulation data and optimizing models for faster HW design feedback loops
<!-- - Designed and taped out SerDes and optical interconnects for commercial CPUs, achieving 40Gbps/channel and 10pJ/bit/channel respectively -->

**PhD EE, Stanford University, CA**

Reserach: Sub-atomic imaging of carrier in semiconductors using advanced microscopy

Selected ML Projects
--------------------

* **Image Segmentation for Root Detection**:
  Built and trained a U-Net based segmentation model for identifying fine grain root structures.  Achieved 95% Dice coefficient, reducing manual annotation time from hrs to seconds per image. Published in [AGU](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AGUFMB074...05T), [New Phytologist](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/nph.18031)

* **Satellite Image Classication Pipeline**:
  Built a ML pipelines (preprocessing, augmentation) for classifying satelite imagery using DenseNet architecture, achieving 97% classification accuracy. [[pub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11166)]

* **Scalable NLP Pipeline for Content Summarization and Tagging**:
  Designed and deployed an NLP pipeline using BERT for summarization and classification.Optimized for production with scalable inference, serving ~1000 queries/day and improving content moderation speed by 40%
