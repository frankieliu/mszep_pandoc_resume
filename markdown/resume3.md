Experience
----------

**Staff Software Engineer, Google, CA (2020 -- present)**

Led initiatives to improve operational efficiency across Google's global data center infrastructure, resulting in multi-million dollar cost savings.

- Designed and deployed a cross-service telemetry platform for real-time anomaly detection, reducing debugging latency by 10x.
- Built a system for multi-dimensional data aggregation and ML-assisted root cause analysis, cutting investigation time from weeks to days.
- Built a RAG LLM-based system to automate triage of support tickets, significantly reducing on-call toil and manual load.

**Member of Technical Staff Software Engineer, Oracle (2010 -- 2020)**

Worked across automation, hardware optimization, and ML systems to improve design and operational workflows.

- Automated analog circuit generation at 10nm using ML-based design rules, improving performance by >10% and reducing product cycles by ~3.5 weeks.
- Built internal tools integrating simulation data to accelerate feedback loops for hardware design and verification.

**PhD in Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, CA**

Focus: Sub-atomic imaging of carriers in semiconductors using advanced microscopy.

Projects & Publications
-----------------------

* **Image Segmentation for Root Detection**:
  Developed a U-Net-based segmentation model (PyTorch) for identifying fine-grained root structures. Achieved 95% Dice coefficient, cutting manual annotation time from hours to seconds per image. Published in [AGU](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AGUFMB074...05T), [New Phytologist](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/nph.18031).

* **Satellite Image Classification Pipeline**:
  Built an ML pipeline for satellite image classification using DenseNet, including preprocessing and augmentation. Achieved 97% classification accuracy. [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11166)].

* **Scalable NLP Pipeline for Content Summarization and Tagging**:
  Designed and deployed a scalable BERT-based NLP pipeline for content summarization and tagging, serving approximately 1,000 queries/day. Improved content moderation throughput by 40% and reduced manual review workload.

<!-- - Designed and taped out SerDes and optical interconnects for commercial CPUs, achieving 40Gbps/channel and 10pJ/bit/channel respectively -->
